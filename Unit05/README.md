An object's state refers to its attributes and values at any given time.

## 5.3 - Documentation with Comments

Static methods cannot change or access the values of instance variables.
Static methods can change and access the values of static variables.

## 5.8 - Scope and Access

Use "method decomposition" to break down large issues into "subproblems" to be more efficient in coding.

## 5.9 - `this` Keyword

The keyword "this" can be used to pass the current object as an actual parameter in a method call.

## 5.10 - Ethical and Social Implications of Computing Systems

Always be aware of legal issues and copyright concerns when coding.
