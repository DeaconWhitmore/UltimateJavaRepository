# 1.5 Casting and Ranges of Variables
```
(int) (x + y) = z
(int) (x.0 + y.0) z.0
```
Some specific code, like values with decimals or the (double) function can cause the answer to be in a decimal state

```
Any result of adding, subtracting, multiplying numbers, etc. can cause an overflow error outside of the bounds of the int limit.
