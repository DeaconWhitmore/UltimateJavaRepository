# Unit 6 - Array

## 6.1 - Array Creation and Access

An array is a data structure used to implement a collection of primitive/object reference data.
An element is a single value in the array.

## 6.2 - Traversing Arrays

Iterations can be used to access all the elements in an array.
Traversing an array with an indexed 'for' or 'while' loop requires elements to be accessed using their indicies.

## 6.3 - Enhanced for Loop for Arrays

Enhanced 'for' loops always includes a variable.
Assigning a new value to this variable does not change the value stored in the array.

## 6.4 - Developing Algorithms Using Arrays

There are standard algorithms to shift/rotate elements in an array left or right
Identify, modify, and develop standard algorithms.
