# Unit 8 - 2D Array

## 8.1 - 2D Array
2D arrays are an array of arrays. They contain an array which describes a list of 1D arrays, but stores them as one object.
In a 2D array with 30 elements, you could access an element by writing String [] [] variable = new String [4] [3]
2D arrays are very similar to arrays.

## 8.2 - Transversing 2D Arrays
To traverse and access elements in a 2D array, use nested for or nested enhanced for loops.
To print an element, use the line System.out.print(grid[][]).
