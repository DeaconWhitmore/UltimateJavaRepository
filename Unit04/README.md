# Unit 4 - Iteration

## 4.1 - `while` Loops

While loops are loops designed to continue until a specific condition is true.

## 4.2 - `for` Loops

For loops are loops that can hold variable information and parameters.

## 4.3 - Developing Algorithms Using Strings

Use methods like .equals, .substring, and .length to maximize efficiency in loops.

## 4.4 - Nested Iteration

Nested Iteration is where there are loops contained within loops.
These loops can be any type, such as for or while.

## 4.5 - Informal Code Analysis

Use knowledge of integers and math to determine how many times a loop will repeat.
Use knowledge of java coding to decipher the message of a loop.
