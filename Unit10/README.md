# Unit 10 - Recursion

## 10.1 - Recursion
A recursive method is a method that calls itself. Recursive methods contain at least one condition.
## 10.2 - Recursive Searching and Sorting
Data must be sorted in order to use the binary search algorithm. A binary search algorithm starts at the middle of a sorted array or ArrayList and eliminates half of it in each iteration until the desired value is found or the array/Arraylist is eliminated completely. The binary search algorithm can be written linearly or recursively.
