# Unit 7 - `ArrayList`

## 7.1 - Introduction to `ArrayList`
The size of an array does not change once it has been created.
Arraylists are able to be changed once they have been created.

## 7.2 - `ArrayList` Methods
int size() returns the number of elements in the list
E get (int index) returns the element at that position
E set (int index, E obj) sets the element to obj at int index
E remove (int index) removes element from position index, moves elements at index + 1 and higher to the left, and subtracts one from the arraylist's size.

## 7.3 - Traversing `ArrayList`s
Enhanced for loop structure: for(DataType Variable: Collection)
Exercise caution when removing and traversing ArrayLists. It is easy to miss elements while removing them.
Ensure that you do not cause an outofbounds exception.

## 7.4 - Developing Algorithms Using `ArrayList`s
Standard ArrayList algorithms use traversal methods to add, delete, and apply standard algorithms.

## 7.5 - Searching
There are many standard algorithms for searching.
Linear algorithms search in sequential order until the desired value is found or all elements are searched.

## 7.6 - Sorting
Run-time comparisons of code program segments can be made using statement execution counts.

## 7.7 - Ethical Issues Around Data Collection
When collecting data such as names or important personal data, use null to prevent unwanted data tracking.
Never ask for sensitive or personal information.
